        <p class="center" id="about">I love the feeling of finally solving problems, whether it be hard or easy.
            I am currently looking for a job in the Software Engineering industry, so please do contact me if you believe that I would be a good fit.
            I've graduated from York University in 2024 for Computer Science, more information about education and skills is in the "Skills and Education" section.
            Projects that have been made for school courses are currently unavailable to view, but newer projects are available to download and try in the Projects section.</p>
